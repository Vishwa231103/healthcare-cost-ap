# ðŸ’¡ Healthcare Cost Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-powered Streamlit app that predicts individual medical insurance costs based on features like age, gender, BMI, children, smoking status, and region.

 ðŸš€ Demo

To run the app locally:

bash
streamlit run healthcare_app.py


ðŸ§  About the Model
The app uses a Linear Regression model trained on the insurance.csv dataset. The model was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure that predictions are reasonably accurate (MAE under $3500).
